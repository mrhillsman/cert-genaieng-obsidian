Each blue square represents the squared error for a specific data point: the vertical distance from the point to the regression line (fitted line) is squared, which visually translates to the size of the blue square. The MSE, as a single number, is the average of all these individual squared errors.

So, the blue squares in the image are visualizing the individual contributions to the total MSE, not the final single value of MSE itself. This approach helps learners see how much each point contributes to the overall error and how the regression line minimizes this error compared to the average line (red line).

The **red squares** in the image represent the squared errors for each data point when the predicted value is based on the **mean of the data points** (the horizontal red line).

Here’s how it works:

1. The **red line** is the average of all the $\large{y}$-values ($\large{\bar{y}}$​), so it doesn't depend on $\large{x}$. It is the simplest model you can have, which assumes every prediction is just the mean of the data.
    
2. For each data point, the squared error is calculated as the squared difference between the actual $\large{y}$-value of the point and $\large{\bar{y}}$​ (the red line). These squared differences are shown as the **red squares** in the diagram.
    
3. When we calculate the **total squared error** for the red line, it is essentially the **sum of squared differences (SST)** from the mean, which measures how much the data points vary around their average.
    

The point of comparing the red squares (SST) to the blue squares (errors of the regression line) is to show that the regression line significantly reduces the total squared error compared to the mean-only model. This reduction in error is captured by the **R-squared** value, which quantifies how much variance the regression line explains relative to the variance around the mean.

In simple terms:

- **Red squares**: Errors when predicting everything as the mean ($\large{\bar{y}}$​).
- **Blue squares**: Errors when predicting with the regression line.
- The goal of regression is to make the blue squares (MSE) as small as possible!

Hypothetically, you can indeed think of the **red line** in the same way as the **blue line**, but with a key difference in the prediction method:

1. The **red line** represents a "model" that predicts the **same value for all data points**—specifically, the mean of the $\large{y}$-values ($\large{\bar{y}}$​).
2. The **red squares** are the individual squared errors between each actual data point and the predicted value ($\large{\bar{y}}$​, the red line).
3. Just like the blue line's squared errors contribute to its **MSE**, the red line's squared errors can be thought of as contributing to its own "MSE" (though in technical terms, we usually call this the **total sum of squares** or SST).

By framing it this way, the key comparison becomes clear:

- The **blue line's MSE** (blue squares) shows how well the regression line predicts the data points.
- The "MSE" of the red line (red squares) shows how well the mean predicts the data points (a very naive model).

Thus, R-squared measures the relative improvement of the blue line (regression model) over the red line (mean-only model). It shows how much better the regression is at predicting the data compared to simply using the mean.

### 1.  $\large{R^2}$ is close to 1

- **Scenario**: The regression line fits the data extremely well. The model explains almost all the variability in the target variable ($\large{y}$) using the predictor variable(s).
- **Example**: A strong linear relationship between the independent variable ($\large{x}$) and the dependent variable ($\large{y}$), such as the relationship between temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- **Interpretation**:
    - The model is highly predictive.
    - Residuals (errors) are very small.
    - Almost all variance in $\large{y}$ is explained by the predictors.
    - Be cautious—it could indicate **overfitting** if the model is too complex for the dataset.

### 2.  $\large{R^2}$ is close to 0

- **Scenario**: The regression line doesn't fit the data well. The model explains very little or none of the variability in $\large{y}$.
- **Example**: Trying to predict someone's height using their shoe size when there’s no strong correlation in the dataset.
- **Interpretation**:
    - The predictors are not meaningful for explaining $\large{y}$, or the relationship between $\large{x}$ and $\large{y}$ is non-linear but the model is linear.
    - Indicates the model is poor at predicting.
    - Check if the data might require transformation (e.g., logarithms for non-linear relationships) or if another type of model might work better.

### 3.  $\large{R^2}$ is close to 0.5

- **Scenario**: The regression line explains some, but not all, of the variability in $\large{y}$.
- **Example**: Predicting test scores using hours of study, where other factors (e.g., test difficulty, personal aptitude) also play a significant role.
- **Interpretation**:
    - The model is moderately predictive, but other factors likely influence $\large{y}$ that are not captured in the current model.
    - The model captures only about 50% of the variability in $\large{y}$.
    - You may want to investigate additional predictors or interactions between variables to improve the model.

### **Key Takeaways for Interpretation**

1. $\large{R^2}$ Close to 1:
    
    - Strong fit, but be mindful of potential overfitting.
    - Look for simplicity in the model to ensure generalization.
2. $\large{R^2}$ Close to 0:
    
    - Poor fit, likely due to irrelevant predictors, inappropriate model type, or noisy data.
    - Consider exploring alternative models or transformations.
3. $\large{R^2}$ Around 0.5:
    
    - The model has moderate predictive power but leaves significant room for improvement.
    - Add more predictors or revise the modeling approach to capture more variance.

**Final Note**: Always pair $\large{R^2}$ with residual analysis, domain knowledge, and other metrics (like adjusted $\large{R^2}$, RMSE, or $\large{p}$-values) to ensure the model's reliability and interpretability!

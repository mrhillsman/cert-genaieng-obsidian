In machine learning, when creating a residual plot, the horizontal axis can represent either the independent variable or the predicted values, depending on the specific analysis you want to perform. Both approaches are valid and provide different insights into your model's performance.

## Residual Plots with Independent Variable

When plotting residuals against the independent variable:

- The horizontal (x) axis represents the independent variable.
- The vertical (y) axis represents the residuals (actual value minus predicted value).

This type of plot helps to:

1. Identify any patterns or relationships between the residuals and the independent variable[1].
2. Detect non-linearity in the relationship between the variables[1].
3. Assess whether the assumption of constant variance (homoscedasticity) holds[4].

## Residual Plots with Predicted Values

Alternatively, you can plot residuals against the predicted values:

- The horizontal (x) axis represents the predicted values.
- The vertical (y) axis represents the residuals.

This approach is useful for:

1. Assessing the overall fit of the model[4].
2. Identifying heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance)[4].
3. Detecting outliers or influential points[4].

## Choosing the Appropriate Plot

The choice between these two types of residual plots depends on your specific analysis goals:

- Use the independent variable on the x-axis when you want to examine the relationship between the residuals and a specific predictor variable.
- Use the predicted values on the x-axis for a more general assessment of model fit and to check for violations of regression assumptions.

In both cases, you're looking for a random scatter of points around the horizontal line at y = 0, with no discernible patterns[1][4]. If you observe patterns or uneven distributions, it may indicate that your model is not capturing all the relevant information or that certain assumptions of the regression analysis are violated[4].

Remember that in multiple regression, you may need to create separate residual plots for each independent variable to thoroughly assess your model's performance[4].

To verify that the residuals do not create a curve or increase in variance as x increases, you should plot the residuals against the independent variable on the horizontal axis. This type of residual plot is most effective for assessing the assumptions of linearity and homoscedasticity in your regression model.

## Residual Plot with Independent Variable

When creating a residual plot to check for these issues:

- The horizontal (x) axis should represent the independent variable.
- The vertical (y) axis should represent the residuals (observed value minus predicted value).

This arrangement allows you to:

1. Check for linearity: A curved pattern in the residuals would indicate a non-linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables[1][3].
2. Assess homoscedasticity: An increase in the spread of residuals as x increases would suggest heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance)[3][4].

## Interpretation

In an ideal residual plot:

- Points should be randomly scattered around the horizontal line at y = 0.
- There should be no discernible patterns or trends.
- The spread of residuals should be roughly constant across all values of the independent variable.

If you observe a curved pattern or a funnel shape (increasing variance), it suggests that your model may not be capturing the relationship between the variables correctly or that certain regression assumptions are violated[3][4].

## Alternative Plots

While plotting residuals against the independent variable is most common for these checks, some analysts also use:

1. Residuals vs. fitted values: This can provide similar insights and is especially useful in multiple regression[1][3].
2. Standardized residual plots: These can help identify outliers and influential points[4].

Remember, a well-fitted model should show a random scatter of residuals with no clear patterns, regardless of which variable is on the horizontal axis.

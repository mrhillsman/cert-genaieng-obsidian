## Model Development
>mathematical equation used to predict a value given one or more other values
>relating one or more independent features to dependent features

the more relevant features you have the more accurate your model is, why?, consider you have two almost identical products like cars, pink cars sell for significantly less, if the features (independent - the input) does not include color, the model will predict the same price even though the pink cars will sell for much less
### Linear Regression / Multiple Linear Regression
single independent feature v multiple independent features

$\Large{x_i}$ -> linear regression -> prediction
$\Large{x_i}$,...$\Large{x_n}$ -> multiple linear regression -> prediction

simple linear regression
- predictor - x
- target - y
$$
\Large{y = b_0 + b_1x}
$$
when you fit or train the model you come up with the intercept and slope

$\Large{b_0}$ - the intercept
$\Large{b_1}$ - the slope
